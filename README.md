# DevOps Learning Journey 🚀

## 👋 Introduction

This repository documents my daily 30-day DevOps learning and hands-on project journey. I will build small projects daily, apply core DevOps concepts, and push everything here.

## 🧠 What is DevOps?

DevOps stands for *Development + Operations*. It is a combination of:

- Practices
- Tools
- Cultural philosophy

It enables faster and more reliable software delivery.

## 🔑 Key DevOps Concepts (Simplified)

- *CI (Continuous Integration)*: Auto-testing code whenever changes are made.
- *CD (Continuous Deployment)*: Auto-deploying tested code to servers.
- *IaC (Infrastructure as Code)*: Managing infrastructure using code.
- *Automation*: Minimizing manual steps in the software lifecycle.
- *Monitoring & Logging*: Observing systems in real-time and reacting to issues.
